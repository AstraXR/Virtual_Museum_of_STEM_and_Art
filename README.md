# Virtual Museum of STEM and Art

## Goal and Vision

High level summary goes here.
The Virtual Museum of STEM and Art aims to create an immersive experience showcasing the innovative work of peers and professors in the fields of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) through artistic expressions such as code, media files, and other digital creations. The vision is to inspire and educate visitors about the intersection of technology and creativity while providing an engaging platform for learning and exploration.

## High Level Requirements

Things that must be completed in order to achieve your goals.

High Level Requirements
Virtual Environment Creation: Design and develop a visually stunning 3D virtual museum environment using Unreal Engine, featuring thematic sections to showcase different STEM art exhibits.

Content Curation and Integration: Gather and curate STEM art pieces from peers and professors, including code snippets, media files, interactive simulations, and digital artworks. Integrate these exhibits seamlessly into the virtual museum environment.

Interactive Exhibits: Implement interactive elements within each exhibit to engage visitors and enhance their learning experience. This may include interactive displays, audiovisual presentations, explanatory text, and links to additional resources.

Gamification Features: Integrate gamification elements to incentivize exploration and interaction within the virtual museum. This could involve incorporating achievements, rewards, challenges, and leaderboards to motivate visitors to engage with the exhibits and explore different areas of the museum.

User Navigation and Interface: Design an intuitive user interface and navigation system that allows visitors to easily explore the virtual museum, navigate between exhibits, and interact with the gamification features. Ensure accessibility for users of all backgrounds and abilities.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the performance of the virtual museum to ensure smooth navigation and interaction, even on lower-end hardware. This includes optimizing rendering settings, asset loading, and overall frame rate stability.
